This week, we will:

- review our solutions to the assembly algorithm!
- practice using BLAST and Clustal Omega to find matching sequences and align multiple sequences. Use Biopython to convert file formats
- review/write our sequence similarity functions -- how do they compare to Clustal's built-in function?
- start working with distance matrices -- intro to genetic distance!
