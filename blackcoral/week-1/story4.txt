start writing below! ===v
My ELA teacher does not like it when we write in pencil. I did that today. She deducted points from my grade and I feel like writing her a letter tomorrow asking her to forgive me.
Dear Nicole,
This has been a traumatic experience for me. I feel fustrated that I got this grade. Yesterday I slept at 2am  because I had to finish my homework.
 
If there is anything I could do to get you to reconsider my grade, it would be awesome. I promise I will never write in pencil again.  

Thank you,
Alex


Apparently, my teacher did not like my letter and took off more points from my grade.  She said that it was not written well enough.
