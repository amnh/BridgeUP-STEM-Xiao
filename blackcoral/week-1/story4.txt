My ELA teacher does not like it when we write in pencil. I did that today. She deducted points from my grade and I feel like writing her a letter tomorrow asking her to forgive me.
Dear Nicole,
This has been a traumatic experience for me. I feel fustrated that I got this grade. Yesterday I slept at 2am  because I had to finish my homework.
