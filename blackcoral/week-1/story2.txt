Was this boy wearing colored contacts? Aren't those really itchy? That's beside the point, she reasoned. Who is this, and is he really my brother?She went up to him and continued to stare. "Do you really not remember me?" he asked her. "Has it been that long". She thought she was going crazy,  yes it had been 2 years since she last saw him but she knew what her own brother looked like. She had to. It wasn't possible for people to rise from the dead she kept on telling herself. Yet, a little part of her wanted to believe that the strange man was in fact her brother.
