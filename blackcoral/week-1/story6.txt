It was a rainy thurday morning. Just like every other morning. It has been raining for the past 180 days. After it was raining for about a month, people got scared. Everyone was afraid of what was coming. They thought we were all at risk. Even the scientists did not know what was wrong. Then one day, I decided to do the unthinkable. I left our home. I left the only place our species has known. When I looked out into the unknown, I saw a huge creature looming above, blind to my existence. All of a sudden, I was drowning in water. I coughed and sputtered, struggling for air. He muttered under his breath in awe, but I heard it..."what a cute earthworm."
