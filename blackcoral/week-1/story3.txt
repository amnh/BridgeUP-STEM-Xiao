Once upon a time, there was a majical fairy. Her name was Margret Tali Audrey and her initials were MTA. Her initials were a fair representation of her job. She was tasked by the majical fairy head master to enter the dreaded NYC Subways and bring joy to the grumpy passangers. The head master had heard about the deteriorating conditions of the subway and hated that so many New Yorkers had to start their morning in a bad way. So, Margret brought her whole family and all her fairy children into the dark, looming subway to make it more cheerful. As the trains passed by through the tunnel, Margret, her husband and children would light up their wands and put on a magical light show for all the people in the train cars.Start writing here! ===v
One day, a little girl and her father were riding on the subway. The little girl, Carol, enjoyed staring out the window and examining the contents of the dark tunnel. Suddenly, the train passed by the beautiful light show. Carol was shocked. How could there be such beautiful light in the subway? She asked her father, but he said that he didn't see anything. Distraught, Carol stared down at the ground and started to cry.
