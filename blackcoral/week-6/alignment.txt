We've discussed assembly -- not it's on to alignment! 

In order to build a tree, we need to make comparisons. Having just discussed how computationally expensive it can be to smooth two contigs into one, you can guess at how time-consuming it must be to comparison thousand-base pair sequences to one another.

Fortunately for us, there's BLAST, an alignment algorithm that does the heavy lifting for us. Even more luckily for us, Biopython has lots of cool built-in functions that talk to BLAST directly! 

We'll be exploring these functions this week as we scour GenBank for black coral genomes!
