We've done lots of work on phylogenetics in theory -- be that mathematics, computer science theory, or candy phylogenies -- 
so it's high time we observed some principles of phylogenetics at work 'in the wild.' We'll be applying our knowledge of
phylogenetic terminology to a scavenger hunt in the museum; later, we'll hear about Dr. Nathalie Goodkin's work, which uses 
coral geochemistry to reconstruct ocean-atmosphere interactions. 

Check below for a bio of Dr. Goodkin: 

Dr. Goodkinâ€™s research is focused on understanding and using coral geochemistry to reconstruct ocean-atmosphere interactions, 
climate behavior, and pollution histories over the past 500 years. 

Her team uses paleoclimate proxies in coral skeleton (e.g., stable isotopes) to reconstruct the climate of the last 500 years.  
The group utilizes coral skeletons as recorders of environmental conditions, providing insights into climate behavior on 
seasonal to decadal time scales. Dr. Goodkin strives to improve our understanding of the influences biological calcification 
on chemical fossils to improve the reliability of biogenic carbonate reconstructions.

In the past five years, Dr. Goodkin has focused on understanding how changes to mean sea surface temperature, salinity and 
circulation interact with the Southeast Asian Monsoon system. As warm water from the Pacific Ocean is pushed through the 
marginal seas of Southeast Asia towards the Indian Ocean, heat is transferred from the ocean to land driving precipitation 
patterns. Understanding how these systems have changed and interacted in the past will be critical to predicting climate in 
the future.
