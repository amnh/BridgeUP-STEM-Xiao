You should've been assigned three of the files in this directory to work on. 

A few notes:

- Each file corresponds to sequence data from a different organism. 
- Each organism's sequence data contains multiple genes -- we don't know which genes are contained within each file, however! 
- You can see each organism's name! 
- Open each file -- do you notice any anomalies immediately? What are they?
