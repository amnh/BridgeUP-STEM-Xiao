Now that you've got your sequence files translated, we can make some sense of what we're looking at. 

Examine the translated sequence -- what do you see? 

You should notice at least three stop codons, evidence of locations where a gene ends (remember that these are encoded as TAA 
or TAG for corals and anemones). This is because there are three genes within each FASTA sequence belonging to each distinct 
organism. 

You know how to BLAST sequences to identify the organism from which a nucleotide sequence might be derived -- but BLAST can
also tell you the identity of the specific gene, too! Pretty cool. 

BLAST each of the genes you've found in your sequence files -- which genes are they? For which organisms?

Next, we'll be visualizing some whole genome sequences -- get excited! In our data-cleaning module, we discussed the importance 
of AT and GC content for determining the presence of coding regions. Turns out, there's a pretty cool way to visualize this
content. We'll be building a simple DNA Walker to examine the contents of our sequences. It works like this: we start at some 
coordinate point (usually (0, 0), though this isn't crucial) and then walk north, south, east, or west depending on what 
nucleotide we've just seen. The result -- a rough sketch of the nucleotide content of our genome, and a good look at some of 
the overarching trends in AT/GC richness in our dataset.
