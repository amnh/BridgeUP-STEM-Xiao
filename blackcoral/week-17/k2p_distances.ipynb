    "Note that substitutions from A to G are called __transitions__ and T to C substitutions are called __transversions__. On the whole, __transversions__ are rarer than __transitions__ and are therefore weighted more heavily. This makes sense -- it's easier for a purine to sub for another purine than it is for a pyrimidine to appear where we should have a purine! It's also why this distance metric is called __2-parameter__. Our previous metric was 1-parameter. "
