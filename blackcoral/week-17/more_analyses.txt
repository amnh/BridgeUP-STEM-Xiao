Now that we've explored our data in depth, it's time for some in-depth analyses! Some of the analyses we'll be doing in the
coming weeks include: 

- purine and pyrimidine content
- AG and CT skew values
- Kimura-2-parameter distances
- threshold values for distinctions between family, order, species
- plotting some of this data in R or Python!
- cord diagrams and other cool visuals!
