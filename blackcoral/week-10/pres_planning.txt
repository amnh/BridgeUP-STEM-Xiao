Winter presentations are on December 20 (next Thursday)! Together, let's jog our memories and think about what we've discussed over the past three months. 

We'll spend today creating an outline for the presentation and researching our slides. Next Tuesday, we'll wrap up our slide design process and run through the presentation once or twice.

So think, recall, and pat yourself on the back -- you've come so far since October!
