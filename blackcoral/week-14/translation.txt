We've discussed the importance of recognizing premature stop codons in our sequence data -- they might be indicative of
a number of issues, including 1) incorrect reading frame, 2) the actual end of a gene, or 3) incorrect translation code. 

We'll be tackling number three this week -- how, exactly, do we account for the fact that different organisms are simply 
built differently? In some ways, it makes sense that the nucleotides that code for one amino acid in a sponge might code 
for something else in a human. 

There are standardized tables for different groups of organisms. You might recall that corals and anemones use table 4,
the Mold and Protozoa table. You'll be reading translation information from this table and putting it into a data dictionary,
which you'll then use to translate your raw nucleotide sequence files.
