# BridgeUP-STEM-Xiao

This is the GitHub repository for Madelyne Xiao's 2018 - 2019 BridgeUP:STEM internship group

This is the home of #coralcrew's internship code and projects. By the end of the internship, we will have :

- written data cleaning, analysis, and visualization scripts for mitogenome data
- gained a deeper understanding of black coral and anemone phylogenies
- built some phylogenetic trees of our own!

Jot down some of your own goals here:
