# BridgeUP-STEM-Xiao

This is the GitHub repository for Madelyne Xiao's 2018 - 2019 BridgeUP:STEM internship group

This is the home of #coralcrew's internship code and projects. By the end of the internship, we will have :

- written data cleaning, analysis, and visualization scripts for mitogenome data
- gained a deeper understanding of black coral and anemone phylogenies
- built some phylogenetic trees of our own!

Jot down some of your own goals here: 


Below, you'll find a week-by-week breakdown of our work. 

Week 1: Github Essentials
- played a collaborative story-writing game called Exquisite Corpse to practice git pulling, pushing, and text-editing on the command line
- learned some nifty new Unix commands and shortcuts!

Week 2: DNA Detectives
- learned about some common features of noisy biological data
- intro to a new Python package, BioPython!

Week 3: Data Cleaning
- began writing our own functions to solve the noisy data problems we encountered last week 

Week 4: Genomes, Assemble!
- discussed the process of genome assembly through a hands-on 'assembly' of familiar and less-familiar sets of song lyrics (context is important!) 
- tried our hand at building trees with a candy phylogeny (happy Halloween!)

Week 5: Assembly Algorithms (short week)
- on Thursday, worked on writing our own brute-force algorithms to align two nucleotide contigs. 
- also discussed big-O notation, algorithmic efficiency, and some common algorithmic problems (e.g., sorting, traveling salesman)

Week 6: Assembly cont'd, beginning Alignment
