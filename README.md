# BridgeUP-STEM-Xiao

This is the GitHub repository for Madelyne Xiao's 2018 - 2019 BridgeUP:STEM internship group

This is the home of #coralcrew's internship code and projects. By the end of the internship, we will have :

- written data cleaning, analysis, and visualization scripts for mitogenome data
- gained a deeper understanding of black coral and anemone phylogenies
- built some phylogenetic trees of our own!

Jot down some of your own goals here: 


Below, you'll find a week-by-week breakdown of our work. 


[__Week 17: ATCG Analysis__](https://github.com/amnh/BridgeUP-STEM-Xiao/tree/master/blackcoral/week-17)
- AT and GC skew analysis for leading/lagging strand identification
- purine and pyrimidine skew analysis for heavy/light strand identification


[__Week 16: Visualizing Genomes__](https://github.com/amnh/BridgeUP-STEM-Xiao/tree/master/blackcoral/week-16)

- translating our raw nucleotide data files using Python dictionaries


[__Week 13: The Whole Pipeline__](https://github.com/amnh/BridgeUP-STEM-Xiao/tree/master/blackcoral/week-13)
- reviewing the pipeline we've built over the past three months, from raw data to tree
- starting an exploratory data analysis of our raw FASTA files


[__Week 12: New Year, New Tree__](https://github.com/amnh/BridgeUP-STEM-Xiao/tree/master/blackcoral/week-12)
- Learning about the variety of tree-drawing methods available
- Using Phylip to build some phylogenetic trees from our distance matrix input files


[__Week 11: Presentations and break__](https://github.com/amnh/BridgeUP-STEM-Xiao/tree/master/blackcoral/week-11)
- presentations -- great job, coral crew!


[__Week 10: More Alignment and Distance Matrices__](https://github.com/amnh/BridgeUP-STEM-Xiao/tree/master/blackcoral/week-10)
- creating input files for tree construction!
- preparing for next week's mid-year presentation


[__Week 9: More Alignment and Distance Matrices__](https://github.com/amnh/BridgeUP-STEM-Xiao/tree/master/blackcoral/week-9)
- building distance matrices from alignment files (and, from distance matrices, building trees!)
- start thinking about Dec. 20 mid-year presentations


[__Week 8: Finishing Assembly, More Alignment__](https://github.com/amnh/BridgeUP-STEM-Xiao/tree/master/blackcoral/week-8)
- we'll present our solutions to the assembly algorithm (at long last!)
- more work on BLAST with Biopython, intro to distance matrices


[__Week 7: Meeting Mercer__](https://github.com/amnh/BridgeUP-STEM-Xiao/tree/master/blackcoral/week-7)
- short week -- on Tuesday, we spoke to Mercer about his research and got a tour of the wet collections -- saw a giant squid, a giant aquatic isopod!


[__Week 6: Assembly cont'd, beginning Alignment__](https://github.com/amnh/BridgeUP-STEM-Xiao/tree/master/blackcoral/week-6)
- made our own DeBruijn graphs with texts of our choice!
- learned about the bridges of Konigsberg problem and Eulerian walks
- began working with BLAST for sequence lookups


[__Week 5: Assembly Algorithms (short week)__](https://github.com/amnh/BridgeUP-STEM-Xiao/tree/master/blackcoral/week-5)
- on Thursday, worked on writing our own brute-force algorithms to align two nucleotide contigs. 
- also discussed big-O notation, algorithmic efficiency, and some common algorithmic problems (e.g., sorting, traveling salesman)


[__Week 4: Genomes, Assemble!__](https://github.com/amnh/BridgeUP-STEM-Xiao/tree/master/blackcoral/week-4)
- discussed the process of genome assembly through a hands-on 'assembly' of familiar and less-familiar sets of song lyrics (context is important!) 
- tried our hand at building trees with a candy phylogeny (happy Halloween!)


[__Week 3: Data Cleaning__](https://github.com/amnh/BridgeUP-STEM-Xiao/tree/master/blackcoral/week-3)
- began writing our own functions to solve the noisy data problems we encountered last week 


[__Week 2: DNA Detectives__](https://github.com/amnh/BridgeUP-STEM-Xiao/tree/master/blackcoral/week-2)
- learned about some common features of noisy biological data
- intro to a new Python package, BioPython!


[__Week 1: Github Essentials__](https://github.com/amnh/BridgeUP-STEM-Xiao/tree/master/blackcoral/week-1)
- played a collaborative story-writing game called Exquisite Corpse to practice git pulling, pushing, and text-editing on the command line
- learned some nifty new Unix commands and shortcuts!
